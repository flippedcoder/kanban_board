# Kanban board

Start by installing all of the project dependencies with:

```bash
npm i
```

Then run the app with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

It'll open on `http://localhost:5173/` and you'll see a route on the screen called `Board`.

Click that and it'll take you to the kanban board at `http://localhost:5173/board`.

There's a button at the top of the page to create new tickets and there are already some existing tickets to play with.

There are some blank test files for where I would have added tests if I had more time.
